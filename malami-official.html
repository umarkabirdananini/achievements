</strong><div>Characterized by COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, the year 2020 recorded low-key operations of many governmental, commercial and social activities.
</div><div>Nevertheless, throughout the year, the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN had been actively engaged and pre-occupied with a lot of public-oriented national engagements.
