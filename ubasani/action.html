                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">For effective administration, a Zonal Constituency Officer was appointed to oversee the activities of all the Local Government constituency offices, as well as supervise all other staff, and deliver reports to the Senator on a weekly basis. This way, the Senator is constantly informed of the goings-on challenges and needs of his constituents and can address them promptly and effectively.
<br>
<br>The Zonal Constituency Office is located at No. 1 Ibrahim Biu Road, by IsahKaita Road, Kaduna State and is open between 8a.m to 6p.m from Monday to Saturday, in order to enable constituents to make reports, complaints, contributions, requests and suggestions on a regular basis. The Senator also makes the conscious effort to visit his Senatorial Zone frequently to interface with his constituents. 
<br>
<br>However, for constituents who are not presently residing in the Senatorial Zone or are in the diaspora, several other communication platforms were created to bridge the communication gap between Senator Uba Sani and his constituents. 
<br>These channels have so – far informed every single step which the Senator has taken since his assumption of office in June till today.&nbsp;<br></p>
